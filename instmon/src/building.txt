Note these instructions are for Linux hosts only. 

To build the instmon binary, cd into the "src" directory and run:

make -f Makefile.<platform>

Building for Windows
====================
Ensure you have the mingw32 tools installed on your host. See 
http://www.mingw.org/ for details. You may have to change the 
name of the compiler in Makefile.win32 depending on the version 
of mingw you're running. Note that currently the 64-bit Windows 
Makefile actually generates a 32-bit instmon binary.

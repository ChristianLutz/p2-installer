According to the info-zip.org FAQ (http://www.info-zip.org/FAQ.html#crypto), 
it indicates crypto capabilities which can be included with zip/unzip are 
quite weak (96 bits). Thus, even if crypto were to be included in unzip, in 
theory it would be safe to be able to export. Furthermore, by default decrypt 
is included in unzip but not crypt. Wtih that said, to remove all doubt, we 
have explicitly built unzip.exe to remove all crypto capabilities. 

1) Unarchive unzip60.tar.gz
2) Go to unzip60/win32/vc8
3) Open unzip.vcproj using Visual Studio 2010
4) Go to properties for unzip project
5) Go to Configuration properties>C/C++>Preprocessor for the Release 
configuration
6) Add NO_CRYPT to the 'Preprocessor Definitions'
7) Build using release configuration
